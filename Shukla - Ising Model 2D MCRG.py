    update the spin at every site, and finally include the presence of an inter-spin coupling and an
    external magnetic field in the grids. This script then performs a few real-space renormalisation
    steps and examines the nearest-neighbour two-point disconnected correlation function,
    G^(2)(i, i+1) = <x_i x_(i+1)>, at various temperatures. We're specifically looking at the

    the standard thing we do with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, but exploiting the fact that
    exp(0) = 1 simplifies matters, since it lets us collapse the min(1, exp(-a)) comparison into a

    Note that if we apply x != y, we would have an anisotropic reduction, which for the Monte Carlo
    renormalisation group process to work correctly requires the Hamiltonian to have an anisotropy
    between the x and y couplings; i.e. something like H = J_x s_x1 s_x2 + J_y s_y1 s_y2.
    
    Also note that if the spins of the block average to zero, we randomly pick a Â±1/2 spin.
    
    Finally, note that this does a simultaneous x-direction and y-direction reduction, so if we want
    to do more i-reductions than j-reductions for some perverse reason, we should split up the
    reduction into two calls to reduction(); one where both are reduced together, and one where the
