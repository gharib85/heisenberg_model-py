''' Here, we create a static 2D N-by-M Ising grid of spins up and down, an update mechanism to
    update the spin at every site, and finally include the presence of an inter-spin coupling and an
    external magnetic field in the grids. This script then performs a histogram analysis of the
    lattices generated. This is part of an attempt to recreate the weighted histogram analysis
    method (WHAM) seen in A. Ferrenberg & R. Swendsen, Phys. Rev. Lett. 61, 23 (1988) and
    A. Ferrenberg & R. Swendsen, Phys. Rev. Lett. 63, 12 (1989). We're specifically looking at the
    two-state Ising model, i.e. with spins Â±1/2.'''

''' Following Swendsen's remark, I'll exploit the fact that exp(0) = 1 and that P = exp(-beta*E),
    which here is P = exp(-2*beta*h*spin). Since we have P as 1 for E < 0 and exp(-beta*E) for
    E > 0, it suffices to compare the result of random.random() with exp(-2*beta*h*spin). This is 
    the standard thing we do with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, but exploiting the fact that
    exp(0) = 1 simplifies matters, since it lets us collapse the min(1, exp(-a)) comparison into a
    single line.

    Note that here, I iterate over the array size, rather than the array elements. This is because
    I'm not sure how to call individual entries in the 2D array aside from listing their
